    "NYC is a massive place with hundreds of neighborhoods. Finding a place to live can be a dauting task. Some factors to think about when narrowing down a place is how much variety will your neighborhood afford you and how many green spaces/parks will you be near. The park consideration is extra important if you have a dog.\n",
    "I'd like to be able to cluster neighborhoods by the amount of venues, the unique venue types, the number or parks, and the size of those parks. It would be good to know how neighborhoods are similar to dissimilar so we can then decide which would fit my desired lifestyle."
